# Truck Load Optimizer

This project provides utilities to allocate orders to trucks.

Use `run_optimizer.py` to run one of the available algorithms:

```
python run_optimizer.py --algorithm ffd      # first fit decreasing (original script)
python run_optimizer.py --algorithm bestfit # best fit decreasing example
```

Both commands expect the `PRE_ORDER.xlsx` file in the current directory or can
be pointed to another file using `--file`.
